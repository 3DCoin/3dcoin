What is 3DCoin?
----------------

It is a crypto-currency ran with a blockchain created specially to enable the Districts decentralization, either for the city and Dapps hosting, the vote system, or asset ownership.
For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the 3DCoin Core software, see https://www.3dcoin.io

3Dcoin Script:
----------------

Modifications were brought to the Bitcoin script system, functions can take arguments allowing a better use of the stack depth, expanding and simplifying the scripting process. A safe script verification module is also implemented to prevents peers from rebroadcasting defective Dapps or transactions. user funds are also protected by the exclusion of unspendable transactions from the network.


What is Districts?
----------------

Districtâ€™s 3D world is a miniverse of its own. What this means is that real life entities like other humans (users), business buildings, hospitals, schools, cinemas, etc. Will exist as standalone entities with full interactive capabilities.
Project Districts is an unlimited Virtual Representation of the real world.
