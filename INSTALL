Building 3DCoin Core

Before trying to build, be sure to read one of these files,
depending on your environment:

  doc/build-unix.md
  doc/build-openbsd.md
  doc/build-osx.md
  doc/build-windows.md

After installing the needed dependencies,
use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/BlockchainTechLLC/3dcoin/releases

Masternode auto build script available here:
https://github.com/BlockchainTechLLC/masternode

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building 3dcoind,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of 3DCoin.
