3DCoin Core 0.13.3
=====================

Intro
-----
3DCoin is a peer to peer blockchain based platform allowing users to manage 
their business automatically by programming transactions to fulfil any contract. 
In other words, it cuts out any third party or a trusted escrow, which is an impressive change.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run 3dcoin-qt.exe.

3DCoin Core is the original 3DCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of 3DCoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

See the 3dcoin wiki at:
